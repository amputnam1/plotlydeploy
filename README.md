# Belly Button Biodiversity Assignment 

In this challenge I created an interactive dashboard in order visualize demographic information on the bacterial data for each volunteer of the study. Specifically, the dashboard helps to visualize and identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. 

This will provide the information needed for Improbably Beef to identify a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef. 

This assigned consists of four technical analysis deliverables including the following:

1. A Horizontal Bar Chart
2. A Bubble Chart
3. A Gauage Chart
4. A Customized Dashboard

# Tools and Programming Lanuages used include:
JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js as well as a GitHub (GitHub.io) folder.
